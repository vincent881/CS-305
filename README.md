Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They want a way to modernize their operations using a RESTful web application programming interface. Artemis Financial is also seeking expertise about how to protect their organization from external threats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did very well creating a certificate authentication for Artemis Financial. This was helpful to establish a secure HHTPS Protocol connection. It is important to code securely to protect against data leaks. Software security can put a compan at ease because they do not have to worry about attacks or leaks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the OWASP Dependency check was difficult for me. I had to refactor the code many times for it to properly build.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To increase layers of security, I used multiple different software tools. In the future, I would use the OWASP Dependency check and certificate authentication to assess vulnerabilities and decide which techniques to use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make certain the code and software was functionally secure, I ran the MAVEN Dependency check after supressing the false positives showed no new vulnerabilities. I used the OWASP Dependency check to be certain that no new issues arose.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I used many different tools that can help me on future assignments. They are MAVEN and OWASP Dependency check, Eclipse IDE for Java, and I also used industry standard coding practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From this assignment, I will show future employers that I can run dependency checks.
